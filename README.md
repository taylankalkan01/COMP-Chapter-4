# Repetition Structures & loops
**_Project Name_**  | **_Description_**
------------- | -------------
[WhileLoop.java](https://github.com/taylankalkan01/COMP-Chapter-4/blob/master/Repetition%20Structures%20%26%20loops/src/WhileLoop.java)  | This program uses several while loops to print a sequence of numbers and calculates the sum and average of these numbers.
[LoopWithCounter.java](https://github.com/taylankalkan01/COMP-Chapter-4/blob/master/Repetition%20Structures%20%26%20loops/src/LoopWithCounter.java) | There are 10 students, each with a test score.This program inputs 10 test scores, calculates the average score, and finds the highest score (assume there is no tie). Because we know in advance that there are 10 students, so the counter-controlled while loop is used.
[LoopWithSentinel.java](https://github.com/taylankalkan01/COMP-Chapter-4/blob/master/Repetition%20Structures%20%26%20loops/src/LoopWithSentinel.java)  | There are a number of students, each with a test score. This program inputs a test score for each student, calculates the average score, and finds the highest score (assume there is no tie) until a sentinel value is entered. Because we don't now in advance the number of students, so the sentinel-controlled while loop is used. The sentinel is a special value to indicate the end of loop.
[LoopWithFlag.java](https://github.com/taylankalkan01/COMP-Chapter-4/blob/master/Repetition%20Structures%20%26%20loops/src/LoopWithFlag.java)  | This program is similar to [LoopWithSentinel](https://github.com/taylankalkan01/COMP-Chapter-4/blob/master/Repetition%20Structures%20%26%20loops/src/LoopWithSentinel.java) program. We use a boolean value flag to control the loop execution. Initially the flag is set to true. If the user input is equal to the sentinel value, the flag is set to false to end the loop.
[SimpleInterest.java](https://github.com/taylankalkan01/COMP-Chapter-4/blob/master/Repetition%20Structures%20%26%20loops/src/SimpleInterest.java)  | A simple interest on a loan is calculated by the following formula. This program prompts the user to enter the principal, annual interest rate, time period in days for several loans, and calculates the simple interest charge for each loan. The number of loans is unknown. So a sentinel-controlled loop is used to control the loop execution.
[Factorial.java](https://github.com/taylankalkan01/COMP-Chapter-4/blob/master/Repetition%20Structures%20%26%20loops/src/Factorial.java) | This program uses several while loops to print a sequence of numbers and calculates the sum and average of these numbers.
[Fibonacci.java](https://github.com/taylankalkan01/COMP-Chapter-4/blob/master/Repetition%20Structures%20%26%20loops/src/Fibonacci.java)  |  The Fibonacci sequence of numbers start with 0 and 1, then the following number is the addition of two previous numbers. This program inputs an index (position) and then calculates Fibonacci number at this index.
[PrimeNumber.java ](https://github.com/taylankalkan01/COMP-Chapter-4/blob/master/Repetition%20Structures%20%26%20loops/src/PrimeNumber.java) | A prime number is a positive integer that has exactly two positive integer factors, 1 and itself. This program inputs a positive integer n and determines whether or not n is a prime number.
[GCD.java](https://github.com/taylankalkan01/COMP-Chapters_Java/blob/master/Repetition%20Structures%20%26%20loops/src/GCD.java) | This program uses the Euclidean algorithm to calculate the greatest common divisor of two positive integers.

# Decision & Selection
**_Project Name_**  | **_Description_**
------------- | -------------
[MinValue](https://github.com/taylankalkan01/COMP-Chapters_Java/blob/master/Decision%20%26%20Selection/src/MinValue.java)  | The purpose of this program is to use a one-way selection structure to determine the smallest value among three integers.
[PrintingService](https://github.com/taylankalkan01/COMP-Chapters_Java/blob/master/Decision%20%26%20Selection/src/PrintingService.java)  | Suppose that the cost of printing large photos (24 x 36) is calculated as follows: (- Service charge $3.00- $7.99 per copy for the first 10 copies- $7.25 for each addition copy.) Write a program that prompts the user to enter the number of copies to print, then calculates and prints the amount due.
